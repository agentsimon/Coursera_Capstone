Introduction


Hue and Da Nag are two cities in central Vietnam. They are both on the coast of Vietnam, but Da Nang is more renowned for beaches than Hue. 
Hue on the other hand is known for being the former center of power in Vietnam and was the sett of Royalty until 1947.  
Both a major tourist attractions, or at least were until Covid19. 
Originally I wanted to compare the influence on the cities of the Covid19 lockdown in the fall of 2020 because Da Nang was in lockdown and Hue wasn't. 
As it is not possible to gather data from Foursquare based on date I will compare the two cities as they stand today.
In particular I will look at the tips and see if there is a correlation between the length of the tip and the rating given.
